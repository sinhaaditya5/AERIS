# AERIS — Data Contracts

> ⚠️ **Real production inputs; no fabricated fallback.** Files published through `data/live/` and the UI must come from real captured feeds or explicitly modelled outputs derived from those feeds. If an input is unavailable, return an error. Tests may use labelled captured responses or isolated mathematical cases. Task 4 permits explicitly labelled `BASELINE_SIMULATED` physics scenarios for optional surrogate training/evaluation outside `data/live/`; they are never real observations, historical calibration, or a replacement for unavailable live data.

The shared file formats every member codes against. Change one only via PR and tell the downstream owner. All times are ISO-8601 UTC. Coordinates are WGS84 (`lat`, `lon`). Real snapshots live in `data/live/`. The JSON blocks below only illustrate each format; their values are placeholders and are **never** to be used as data.

  "generated_at": "2026-10-10T06:00:00Z",
  "source": "OpenAQ+CPCB/data.gov.in",
  "stations": [
    {"id": "DL_ANAND_VIHAR", "name": "Anand Vihar", "lat": 28.647, "lon": 77.316,

Optional AQI fetch metadata is preserved through bronze storage, gold publication,
`GET /aqi` / `GET /stations`, frontend validation and the AQI panel. Old captures
without these fields remain valid; missing metadata means unknown, never success.

- `source` names providers contributing usable readings, or `none` when no provider
  contributes a reading. Each station retains its own `source`.
- `sources_with_readings` lists contributing providers; legitimate zero PM2.5 or AQI
  counts as a reading. `sources_failed` lists providers with full **or partial**
  fetch failures, so a provider can appear in both lists.
- `source_fetch_status` maps provider names to `SUCCESS`, `PARTIAL_FAILURE`,
  `FAILED`, `NOT_CONFIGURED` or `UNKNOWN`. OpenAQ station-level request failures
  retain other station readings and mark that provider `PARTIAL_FAILURE`.
  An explicit valid empty `results` / `records` array is a successful response;
  malformed JSON, missing arrays and upstream errors are failures. Uninstrumented
  helper results do not establish that distinction and remain `UNKNOWN`.
- `fetch_status` is `COMPLETE` when the selected requests succeeded, `PARTIAL`
  when known failures/unconfigured providers coexist with successful requests,
  `FAILED` when configured requests failed without successful requests,
  `UNAVAILABLE` when no provider is configured, or `UNKNOWN` without sufficient
  evidence. This describes request outcomes, **not regional sensor coverage**.
- `coverage_complete` is `false` for known fetch gaps and `null` when completeness
  cannot be established. This fetcher never emits `true`: caps, pagination,
  eligibility, missing observations and unknown averaging periods prevent a claim
  of complete regional coverage. An external `true` is displayed only as a
  producer claim and is rejected if accompanied by known fetch gaps.
- `data_status` is `READINGS_AVAILABLE` or `UNAVAILABLE_OR_EMPTY`; successful empty
  responses and failures both lack readings, distinguished only by available fetch
  evidence. Neither empty state proves clean air. Empty/all-null results are never
  published as a successful refresh by the ingestion handler or pipeline.

`generated_at` is a capture time, not a measurement time. `observed_at` is UTC only
when the source timezone is known; ambiguous source times remain `null` with the
original `source_timestamp` and `timestamp_status` disclosure. AQI sub-index and
averaging-period limitations remain unchanged. A retained capture's fetch metadata
does not report subsequent failed ingestion attempts; the API has no separate
latest-attempt status channel. Freshness and observation age remain distinct.

## `wind.json` (Meenal)
Point forecasts on a coarse grid (about 0.25°), hourly for 0–48 h.
```json
{
  "generated_at": "2026-10-10T06:00:00Z",
  "source": "Open-Meteo GFS",
  "points": [
    {"lat": 30.75, "lon": 75.75,
     "hours": [{"t": "2026-10-10T06:00:00Z", "u_ms": 3.1, "v_ms": 2.4,
                "speed_ms": 3.9, "dir_from_deg": 232, "pblh_m": 420}]}
  ]
}
```
`u_ms` is eastward, `v_ms` northward. `dir_from_deg` is the compass direction the wind blows **from**.

## `sites.geojson` (Meenal)
GeoJSON `FeatureCollection` of `Point`s.
```json
{"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [77.21, 28.61]},
 "properties": {"id": "s_0001", "name": "Govt Girls Sr Sec School", "type": "school",
                "occupancy": 1200, "source": "OSM"}}
```
`type` is `school` or `hospital`. `occupancy` is students or beds (null if unknown).

## `population.json` (Meenal)
```json
{"cell_km": 1.0, "cells": [{"lat": 28.61, "lon": 77.21, "pop": 18400}]}
```

## `sources.json` (Pritam)
```json
{
  "generated_at": "2026-10-10T06:05:00Z",
  "sources": [
    {"id": "src_001", "type": "stubble_burning", "lat": 30.9, "lon": 75.8,
     "fire_count": 42, "total_frp_mw": 610.3, "radius_km": 12.0,
     "first_seen": "2026-10-10T03:10:00Z", "last_seen": "2026-10-10T05:42:00Z",
     "confidence": 0.91, "emission_strength": 0.74}
  ]
}
```
`emission_strength` is normalised 0–1.

Source classification, confidence and emission strength are uncalibrated
fire-cluster heuristics, not proof of land use or causal source attribution.

## `corridor.geojson` (Pritam)
`FeatureCollection` of `Polygon`s, one per source and time band, plus one `LineString` centreline per source. Top-level members: `generated_at`, `forecast_start` (hour 0 of the advection) and `wind_generated_at` (the `wind.json` it used).
```json
{"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "Polygon", "coordinates": ["..."]},
 "properties": {"kind": "band", "source_id": "src_001", "hour_from": 0, "hour_to": 2,
                "risk": 0.82, "pm25_delta_ugm3": 95.0}}
{"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "LineString", "coordinates": ["..."]},
 "properties": {"kind": "centerline", "source_id": "src_001",
                "points_eta_hours": [0, 1, 2, 3]}}
```
`risk` is 0–1 and `pm25_delta_ugm3` is the forecast PM2.5 increase from the source's smoke at that band.

In the current baseline, band concentration is a modelled peak over selected
cells/hourly frames, not an observed or uniform receptor concentration. Risk is
an uncalibrated relative score; centreline ETA values are frame times for puff
mass centres, not guaranteed first arrival or a medical exposure probability.
The model supports up to 48 hours only when the supplied wind/PBLH covers every
required location/time. See [model status and limits](../models/README.md).

## `ranked_sites.json` (Meenal)
```json
{
  "generated_at": "2026-10-10T06:10:00Z",
  "exposed_population": {
    "estimate": 1200000,
    "low": 900000,
    "high": 1500000,
    "method": "Population cells inside corridor bands with band risk ≥ 0.30 (estimate). Low: threshold raised to 0.45. High: threshold lowered to 0.15. This is a threshold sensitivity range, not a statistical confidence interval.",
    "data_available": true
  },
  "sites": [
    {"rank": 1, "site_id": "s_0042", "name": "AIIMS Delhi", "type": "hospital",
     "lat": 28.567, "lon": 77.21, "occupancy": 2200,
     "eta_hours": 1.8, "pm25_delta_ugm3": 110.0, "risk_score": 0.93,
     "source_id": "src_001"}
  ]
}
```
`exposed_population` fields:
- `estimate`: integer >= 0, population in corridor bands with band risk >= configured threshold (default 0.30).
- `low`: integer >= 0, conservative scenario with threshold raised by delta (default 0.45).
- `high`: integer >= 0, liberal scenario with threshold lowered by delta (default 0.15).
- `method`: human-readable description of the threshold sensitivity methodology, explicitly clarifying that this is a threshold sensitivity range rather than a statistical confidence interval.
- `data_available`: boolean flag indicating whether population raster cells were available and processed (`true`) or absent (`false`), ensuring an unavailable population fallback is distinguishable from a calculated zero-exposure finding.


## `actions.json` (Saba)
```json
{
  "generated_at": "2026-10-10T06:12:00Z",
  "summary": "Smoke from Punjab will reach Delhi in about 2 hours...",
  "actions": [
    {"priority": 1, "site_id": "s_0042", "who": "Hospital administrator",
     "action": "Switch to filtered air in ICU wards; postpone elective outdoor activity",
     "reason": "ETA 1.8 h, forecast PM2.5 +110 µg/m³, 2,200 beds",
     "deadline_hours": 1.0}
  ],
  "authority_actions": [
    {"who": "DPCC / CAQM", "action": "Issue GRAP-aligned advisory for north-west Delhi",
     "reason": "1.2M people in corridor"}
  ]
}
```
`generator` records what wrote the plan: `bedrock:<model id>` (Strands agent on Amazon Bedrock) or `rules` (the deterministic plan built from the same data).
