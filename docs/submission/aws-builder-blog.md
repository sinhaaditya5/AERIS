# Seeing the smoke before it arrives: AERIS on AWS

*Draft for AWS Builder Center — Aditya (AWS lead), AERIS team. Not published. The architecture below is configured in SAM and includes earlier team-reported deployment notes; current remote CI, live feeds and AWS deployment were not verified in this readiness milestone. Check each remote claim and placeholder before publishing. Local evidence: [READINESS.md](READINESS.md).*

## The problem

Every October and November, crop-residue fires in Punjab and Haryana add smoke to Delhi NCR's air. We wanted to explore source candidates, simulated transport paths, nearby schools and hospitals, and reviewable response suggestions. Whether this provides useful lead time requires independent historical validation.

AERIS (AI Environmental Risk & Intervention System) presents that exploratory workflow on one map; it does not establish causal attribution, calibrated concentrations or operational safety. We set one rule early, and it shaped everything below: **real data only**. Production observations have no invented fallback. Offline captures are timestamped; synthetic boundary tests and optional baseline-simulated ML training are separately labelled. If a source is down, the UI says so.

## What the SAM template configures

Everything is in one SAM template in `ap-south-1` (Mumbai):

- **Ingestion.** EventBridge Scheduler runs Python 3.12 Lambdas on arm64:
  - NASA FIRMS (VIIRS active fires) every 15 minutes
  - OpenAQ and data.gov.in station AQI every 30 minutes
  - Open-Meteo GFS wind and boundary-layer height every 60 minutes

  Each key lives in Secrets Manager under `aeris/*`. A function's role can read only its own key, and keys are cached within a running process. Verify cache refresh/cold-start behavior when rotating credentials. Raw results go to `s3://…/bronze/<feed>/<timestamp>.json` plus a `latest.json` pointer.
- **Failure handling.** Fetchers have configured SQS dead-letter queues. Publication guards retain previous usable data on missing measurements or failed fetches. Current DLQ/deployment behavior remains unverified remotely.
- **Pipeline.** Every 30 minutes (or via `POST /run`), Step Functions runs five Lambdas in order. Each step writes one contract file to `gold/`:
  1. *Publish* the latest feeds
  2. *Detect* sources by clustering fire detections (DBSCAN on haversine distance, weighted by fire radiative power)
  3. *Advect* a smoke corridor hour by hour along the forecast wind, producing time bands for 0–2, 2–4, 4–8 and 8–24 h
  4. *Rank* the OpenStreetMap schools and hospitals inside the corridor, and sum WorldPop population inside it
  5. *Agent*: write the action plan
- **Agent.** The action agent uses the open-source **Strands Agents SDK** with a `BedrockModel`. Its tools only read the `gold/` files, so the model sees the same numbers the map shows. The plan comes back as a typed object; validation rejects unknown sites and invalid deadlines. This does not guarantee free-form factual grounding. Both model and rules plans are advisory and require review; they do not establish clinical or legal authority. If Bedrock is unavailable, a rules-based plan is built from the same data, and the `generator` field in `actions.json` records which one ran.
- **Serving.** An API Gateway HTTP API calls one Lambda that reads `gold/`. Every response carries `generated_at`, `age_seconds` and `stale`. CloudFront serves the React + MapLibre app from a private S3 bucket through origin access control.
- **Operations.**
  - Each function logs to its own group with 7-day retention
  - CloudWatch alarms on Lambda errors, DLQ depth and failed pipeline runs email us through SNS
  - A $50 monthly budget alerts at 50%, 80% and 100%
  - `scripts/smoke_test.py` triggers a run and validates every route against our data contracts

There is no NAT gateway and no always-on instance. Actual operating cost has not been measured here: `<owner-verified figure and date from Cost Explorer>`. Do not publish an estimated cost as an observed bill.

## What fought back

**1. The smoke always went to Delhi.** Our first corridor model looked great on the map: every plume drifted neatly south-east toward Delhi. In review we found out why. The wind lookup took `abs(u)` and `-abs(v)`, which forced every trajectory south-east whatever the forecast said. It also used the first hour in the wind file, and Open-Meteo returns the previous day as well, so the model was advecting with yesterday's wind. Current regression tests check signed vectors and matching forecast times; this does not establish a specific observed trajectory or forecast skill. Lesson: test a physical model's direction against its input, not against the story you expect it to tell.

**2. "Latest" was empty right after midnight UTC.** With a one-day window, the first FIRMS runs after the UTC date changes return nothing until the day's first satellite pass. The configured request spans two days. Total feed failures propagate and publication guards preserve previous usable detections; a genuine empty response is distinguished from a failed fetch.

**3. Lambda's file system is read-only.** The fetchers were written to save into `data/live/`. On Lambda that path is `/var/task/data`, which is read-only, and the error went straight into the DLQ. The fix was a storage interface with two backends: local files for teammates, S3 when `AERIS_STORAGE=s3`. Teammates never needed AWS credentials.

**4. Lifecycle rules versus one-time data.** `bronze/` expires after 14 days to keep costs down. But the OpenStreetMap sites and WorldPop population are pulled once, and they would have expired in the middle of judging. They now live in a separate `reference/` prefix with no expiry rule.

**5. The UI threw away the stale flag.** The API marked old data `stale: true`, but the frontend validates responses with zod, and zod strips unknown keys. We now record freshness before parsing and show a banner. The same review found a dozen hard-coded "fallback" numbers in the UI, left over from an early snapshot: 570,938 people, AQI 179 and others. Each one now shows "—" instead.

**6. Small infrastructure-as-code traps.**
- YAML anchors are handy in a Step Functions definition, but CloudFormation rejects YAML aliases, so we expanded them inline
- A missing S3 key returns `AccessDenied`, not `NoSuchKey`, unless the role also has `s3:ListBucket`. Without it, our clean 404s became 500s
- Bedrock model availability varies by region. The model ID is a stack parameter, so switching to a cross-region inference profile is a redeploy, not a code change

## Current scientific limits

Saved source/corridor artifacts are identified by exact hashes, including evidenced Git LF/Windows CRLF copies. Original run/input/parameter bindings remain unknown; archived corridor values have obsolete floors. New pipeline outputs preserve hash-bound inputs, parameters and semantics through API/schema/browser paths. A checksum or replay does not establish authentication, original lineage or calibration. PM2.5 is a source-band peak, population/risk are proxies, and the station layer has no interpolation.

## What we would do next

- Calibrate corridor PM2.5 against station observations along the path, using Open-Meteo history
- Add Sentinel-5P NO₂/CO to confirm a plume really left the source
- Evaluate the optional baseline-simulated ML surrogate independently before deployment; the production corridor remains physics-based
