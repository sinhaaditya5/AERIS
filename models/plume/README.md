# Lagrangian plume corridor baseline

The 2026-10-10 risk hardening adds optional companion provenance without changing
the puff equations, peak statistic or GeoJSON schema. See
[the remediation report](../../docs/audits/hardcoded-data/2026-10-10/contributor-work-tally/PRITAM_RISK_REMEDIATION.md)
for the current assessment; earlier verification counts remain historical.

The local CLI accepts `--provenance-output <separate-file.json>`. Use an isolated
`--output` path and genuinely covered `--start`/`--hours`; this does not relax wind
coverage or supply missing weather. The companion binds actual source/wind/output
bytes, code hash, parameters, parameter source, capture times and forecast start.
It explicitly labels each band's concentration as the source-wide maximum over
sampled grid cells and hourly frames, including disconnected polygons. This is
not a uniform or facility-local concentration; `risk` is not a health probability.
Use `concentration_at()` and eligible independent history for receptor validation.

`python -m models.common.provenance data/live/corridor.geojson --kind corridor`
labels the exact preserved archive `ARCHIVED_LEGACY`. The
[hash registry](../ARCHIVED_OUTPUTS.json) discloses the removed floor formulas and
the absence of a recorded original input/parameter binding. A new calculation
using archived sources records that lineage in its companion rather than
silently presenting it as fresh detection output. Other unbound files remain
unknown. Companions establish byte binding, not external-source authentication,
calibration or forecast skill. Existing pipeline/API/UI integrations still need
to consume these disclosures before operational use. Companion and output writes
are separate; always verify the binding before consuming a pair.

This is a simplified Lagrangian puff/advection baseline.
It is not WRF-Chem and is not a full atmospheric chemistry model.

The model estimates an **uncalibrated increment above background** from candidate
fire sources. It does not invent a background, ingest observations, attribute
ambient pollution, or provide medically validated public-health probabilities.
All default physical parameters and the empirical concentration conversion are
assumptions. This package includes a calibration-ready engine with strict history
eligibility; actual observational calibration remains blocked. The optional ML
surrogate lives separately in `models/training/` and is not used by the corridor
pipeline. These model packages make no network requests or downloads.

## Architecture and public interface

`advect.py` validates inputs, prepares wind interpolation, defines parameters
and puff state, and performs projected transport. `corridor.py` evaluates
Gaussian concentrations, extracts polygons, produces GeoJSON, and provides the
local CLI. The existing source-detection algorithm is unchanged.

```python
from models.plume.advect import PlumeParams
from models.plume.corridor import predict_corridor

# Both dictionaries come from real local ingestion/model outputs.
result = predict_corridor(sources, wind, hours=48, params=PlumeParams())
```

`params` may also be a dict of dataclass overrides. `forecast_hours` remains a
compatible keyword alias for `hours`; conflicting nondefault values fail.
Horizons must be integer hours in `[1, 48]`. `start` accepts an aware datetime.
The existing `find_nearest_wind(lat, lon, wind, when)` interface is preserved
and now performs linear temporal interpolation as well as spatial IDW.

Inputs follow [`docs/data-contracts.md`](../../docs/data-contracts.md). Source
IDs must be unique; coordinates, scores, FRP/radius/count and UTC observation
ranges must be valid. A full source snapshot requires `generated_at`. An
explicit `start` permits the legacy caller's `{"sources": [...]}` subset.
Malformed values raise `ValueError`. Inputs are never mutated.

Default reference time is the later of the source and wind capture timestamps;
there is no model wall-clock read. It cannot precede the latest source
observation. An explicit earlier-than-capture reference is an **archive replay**,
not a prospective forecast issued at that time. Output `generated_at` and
`forecast_start` record this analysis reference; `wind_generated_at` records
the wind capture. This makes repeated inputs/configuration serialize identically.

## Actual wind interpretation

The checked-in `data/live/wind.json` is an object containing `generated_at`,
`source`, and `points`. Each point has WGS84 `lat`, `lon`, and an `hours` list.
Each hourly entry has an aware UTC `t`, `u_ms`, `v_ms`, `speed_ms`,
`dir_from_deg`, and `pblh_m`.

- `u_ms` is eastward and `v_ms` northward, both in **metres/second**. They are
  already converted physical vectors and are used directly, never reversed.
- `dir_from_deg` is meteorological compass direction **from** which wind blows.
  The ingestion conversion is `u=-speed*sin(direction)`,
  `v=-speed*cos(direction)`. A north wind gives `v < 0`, travelling south.
  Model transport uses u/v; it does not interpolate angles across 0/360 degrees.
- `pblh_m` is boundary-layer height in **metres**. Ingestion allows null PBLH
  and skips hours with absent speed/direction. The captured file has no null
  u/v/PBLH: **323 points x 48 hourly samples**, with 0.25-degree regular spacing
  (19 latitudes 28–32.5, 17 longitudes 73.5–77.5).
- Stored timestamps span **2026-10-06T18:30:00Z–2026-10-08T17:30:00Z**.
  Forty-eight samples provide 47 hours between endpoints, not 48 future hours
  after capture. Neither timestamp labels nor missing data are guessed.

The weather parser previously applied the execution host's timezone to naive
API times despite requesting `timezone=UTC`. It now attaches UTC explicitly
before conversion; a regression test simulates a UTC+05:30 host. The existing
capture's half-hour labels are consistent with that old bug, but its raw API
response is unavailable, so the snapshot is **not relabelled**. Its timing must
be confirmed using a fresh capture before observational calibration or claims
about event timing. Validation here uses the stored aware timestamps literally.

## Wind interpolation and coverage

Prepare each point's valid `(u, v, PBLH)` samples in chronological order. Null
components mark an unavailable sample; nonfinite values, negative PBLH,
malformed timestamps, and duplicate points/timestamps raise errors. There is
no assumed PBLH when real PBLH is unavailable.

At a requested location/time:

1. Calculate WGS84 ellipsoidal geodesic distances to the wind points.
2. Use an exact valid grid point directly; otherwise select up to four nearest
   temporally usable points within the configured 50 km limit.
3. At each point, use an exact timestamp or linearly interpolate between its
   surrounding valid timestamps, only when their gap is at most three hours.
4. Weight these interpolated vectors/heights by `1 / distance**2` and normalize.

Coordinates and times are canonically ordered, including distance ties. A null
grid-point sample may be interpolated across a permitted short gap or use
other actual neighboring samples. No temporal extrapolation is permitted.
Short spatial extension beyond the sampled rectangle is explicitly bounded by
the nearest usable sample distance; it is not unlimited regional persistence.
Failure to find usable local wind/PBLH aborts the forecast. Global start/end
checks and per-puff queries enforce coverage through the terminal frame.

## Coordinate system and advection

Each source uses a WGS84 **azimuthal equidistant** projection centred at its
actual location. This keeps independent sources independent and avoids a
single inappropriate projection for widely separated sources. All numerical
positions, dispersion and grid cells are in **metres**. Output geometries are
transformed back to WGS84 **longitude, latitude** order.

True east/north wind axes differ from projected x/y away from the origin.
Transform their local tangent vectors using projected one-metre WGS84 geodesic
displacements, obtaining the local projection Jacobian `J`. Each explicit
Euler step uses the wind at the beginning of the interval:

```text
dt = 1 hour = 3600 seconds
(vx, vy) = J(location) * (u_ms, v_ms)
x_next = x + vx * dt
y_next = y + vy * dt
```

No degrees-to-metres constant is used. Puff/grid radii have a configurable
default 1000 km limit. Polar sources above 85 degrees and output crossing the
antimeridian fail explicitly; this is a regional baseline. Large or unsupported
domains are not silently drawn across the globe. Hourly Euler stepping and a
local tangent approximation are numerical limitations, not a resolved fluid
model.

## Emission, spread, PBLH and decay

Release one puff per source at forecast hours `0..hours-1`. Each retains source
ID, emission timestamp, age in hours, metre position, input emission strength,
sigma, decay and sampled PBLH. Frames are evaluated at hours `0..hours`, so a
48-hour simulation emits 48 puffs/source and has 49 sample frames.

```text
sigma0_source = max(sigma0_m, source_radius_m / sqrt(2 * ln(10)))
sigma(age_h) = sigma0_source + k_m_sqrt_hour * sqrt(age_h)
decay(age_h) = exp(-age_h / tau_hours)
pblh_factor = 1 / max(real_pblh_m, pblh_floor_m)
```

The radius conversion gives the initial source footprint a Gaussian whose
90%-mass radial distance matches the source's reported radius, unless the
baseline sigma floor is larger. The source detector's radius describes fire
detections; treating it as an initial smoke footprint is an explicit modelling
assumption. Spread cannot decrease with age. Decay starts at one and cannot
increase with age. PBLH is sampled at each puff centre/time; smaller measured
PBLH increases concentration until the 200 m floor. It is not a full boundary
layer, vertical dispersion, deposition or chemistry model. Hourly emissions
persist throughout the requested horizon by assumption, not verified ongoing
fire activity.

## Gaussian concentration, grid and bands

For cell-centre distance `r_m` from a puff centre, evaluate:

```text
C_puff_ugm3 = concentration_scale_ug * emission_strength
               / (2*pi*sigma_m**2)
               * exp(-r_m**2 / (2*sigma_m**2))
               / max(pblh_m, 200)
               * exp(-age_h / tau_hours)
C_cell = sum(C_puff_ugm3 for this source's emitted puffs)
```

The Gaussian horizontal kernel has inverse-square-metre normalization; PBLH
adds inverse metres. `concentration_scale_ug` supplies an **empirical nominal
puff mass/conversion**, not measured pollutant emission mass. A value of
`1e12 ug` corresponds dimensionally to 1000 kg at strength one per hourly puff;
it is uncalibrated and cannot be inferred from FRP normalization alone.
All PM2.5 values are modelled increments, never total ambient PM2.5.

Use per-source grids bounded by simulated trajectories plus four-sigma support,
with 2 km cells by default. Evaluate Gaussian contributions only in their local
support windows, then sum. The four-sigma truncation discards a theoretical
2D Gaussian mass fraction `exp(-8)` (about 0.034%); it is not renormalized.
Cell-centre sampling is approximate. A 250,000-cell limit is checked before
array allocation; forecasts exceeding budgets or projection support fail.
All hours through the requested horizon are calculated, even though the shared
contract only has bands ending at hour 24.

For bands **0–2, 2–4, 4–8, 8–24 h**, take the per-cell maximum across their
integer-hour frames, including both boundaries. Short explicit horizons clip
the final band and omit later bands. Select cells at or above **5 ug/m3**, union
the entire selected cells, repair invalid geometry if necessary, and preserve
holes. There is no geometric smoothing or forced polygon for absent exceedance.
Disconnected unions are emitted as separate **Polygon** features with the same
source/time properties because the actual contract/validator requires Polygon,
not MultiPolygon. Source plumes are never merged with each other.

Band `pm25_delta_ugm3` is the **peak source-specific concentration** across the
selected cells/frames; disconnected parts share that band summary. It is not
a cellwise concentration estimate applying uniformly to every polygon point.
Risk is `1 - exp(-band_peak / risk_scale_ugm3)`, clipped to `[0,1]`: monotonic,
deterministic, and uncalibrated, with no artificial minimum.

## Centreline and output contract

At each frame, calculate the centre of mass of **all surviving puffs** using
weights `emission_strength * decay`. Fresh emissions at the source can pull
this centre back toward the source; it is not the oldest puff's trajectory,
a plume front, or arrival time at any arbitrary target. Changing winds can
bend or reverse the centreline. `points_eta_hours` is the corresponding sample
hour for every vertex, not a guarantee of first smoke arrival at a receptor.

An exactly stationary source has no nonzero-length LineString that passes
Shapely validity. Its valid concentration polygons are retained and the
degenerate line is omitted, rather than inventing displacement. Zero emission
strength creates neither a line nor a band. This documented stationary-case
exception satisfies the actual repository validator but relaxes the prose
expectation of one line per source.

Top-level keys are exactly `type`, `generated_at`, `forecast_start`,
`wind_generated_at`, and `features`. Band/centreline property keys match
`docs/data-contracts.md` exactly. Both the model and CLI run
`pipeline.contracts.check_corridor`, check geometry validity, and forbid NaN/
infinity in JSON. Source IDs, frames, bands, polygon parts and ring orientations
are ordered deterministically. Identical inputs/parameters serialize identically
on the tested runtime; cross-version floating serialization was not tested.

## Parameters and units

| Parameter | Default | Units / role |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `sigma0_m` | 2000 | m; minimum initial horizontal sigma, uncalibrated |
| `k_m_sqrt_hour` | 1000 | m/sqrt(hour); spread growth, uncalibrated |
| `tau_hours` | 24 | hours; empirical removal time, uncalibrated |
| `concentration_scale_ug` | 1e12 | ug/nominal hourly puff at strength one; uncalibrated conversion |
| `grid_cell_m` | 2000 | m; cell width and height |
| `threshold_ugm3` | 5 | ug/m3; corridor extraction assumption |
| `risk_scale_ugm3` | 50 | ug/m3; relative-score saturation assumption |
| `pblh_floor_m` | 200 | m; minimum mixing-depth assumption |
| `wind_neighbors` | 4 | maximum spatial IDW neighbors |
| `idw_power` | 2 | distance-weight exponent |
| `max_time_gap_hours` | 3 | hours; largest permitted interpolation gap |
| `max_wind_distance_km` | 50 | km; nearest usable wind distance limit |
| `kernel_sigma_cutoff` | 4 | sigma units; computational support radius |
| `max_grid_cells` | 250000 | per-source array cell limit |
| `max_projection_radius_km` | 1000 | km; regional projection/grid support limit |

Physical scales must be finite and positive; k may be zero; count/budget
parameters must be positive integers. Policy/numerical settings are also
explicit assumptions, not fitted values. A caller may supply a JSON parameter
file, but file presence alone never means calibration. Actual future calibration
requires correct timestamp provenance, observed PM2.5 histories and held-out
validation; the calibration-ready engine below enforces those eligibility gates.

## CLI and pipeline integration

```bash
python -m models.plume.corridor --live
```

Reads `sources.json` and `wind.json` under `data/live/`, or under
`AERIS_DATA_DIR` with relative paths resolved against the repository root.
Default horizon is 48 h from the latest input capture. No source/wind refresh
is attempted. Optional `--start`, `--hours`, `--params` and `--output` permit
explicit replay/configuration. Validation precedes an atomic output replacement;
missing input, insufficient coverage or calculation failure exits 1 and preserves
prior output. Source/wind inputs cannot be used as output paths.

The checked-in capture cannot support the default 48 h. A useful **explicit
24-hour replay**, preserving tracked output snapshots, is:

```bash
python -m models.plume.corridor --live --hours 24 --start 2026-10-07T08:41:00Z --output .venv/plume-validation-24h.geojson
```

`pipeline.steps.corridor_handler` defaults to 48 h and accepts additive event
options `forecast_hours`, `forecast_start` (aware ISO-8601) and `plume_params`.
It propagates model errors before storage writes. Pipeline snapshot tests now
supply an explicitly covered replay interval rather than silently extrapolating
old archives. The Lambda pipeline requirements add pyproj, already permitted
by the root requirements; no new library family is introduced.

## Tests and limits

```bash
python -m pytest models/plume -q
python -m pytest -q
```

Mathematical tests use labelled controlled vectors and geometry, not claimed
real observations. They verify wind direction, zero wind/symmetry, source
strength, Gaussian mass normalization, decay, dispersion, PBLH floor, changing
winds, puff provenance, mass centres, source independence, 48-hour simulation,
interpolation and coverage, geometry including holes/disconnected parts,
determinism, resource guards, invalid inputs and CLI preservation. Integration
tests read actual captured snapshots. Windows runs use UTF-8 mode and separate
workspace-local pytest temporary directories under ignored `.venv/`.

Python 3.12 syntax/API inspection is separate from runtime tests: the available
runtime is Python 3.14.3; direct Python 3.12 execution and Lambda packaging are
not verified. Further scientific limits include coarse 10 m winds, hourly Euler
steps, IDW smoothing/bounded spatial extension, unverified persistence of fire
emissions, a simplified well-mixed vertical layer, empirical removal, hourly
threshold sampling, and lack of observational calibration/uncertainty estimates.
The numerical tests do not establish real PM2.5 forecast skill.

## Task 2 archived real-snapshot validation result

Source input: `data/live/sources.json`; generated `2026-10-08T14:52:16.603976Z`.
Wind input: `data/live/wind.json`; generated `2026-10-07T18:37:57.090632Z`.
Explicit replay reference: **2026-10-07T08:41:00Z**.

This is an archived 24-hour replay using the stored timestamps and existing
10-source snapshot. The forecast input capture postdates the replay reference,
so this does not demonstrate a prospective forecast or observed PM2.5 skill.
The source and wind files were copied byte-for-byte into an isolated
`AERIS_DATA_DIR`; the actual module CLI was run twice with the explicit
start/horizon. Parameters were not tuned for geographic coverage.

- Horizon: **24 h**; sources: **10**.
- Unique hourly puffs emitted: **240** (24 per source).
- Grid cell size: **2 km**; source grids: **2,750 to 27,412 cells**.
- Polygon features: **34**; centrelines: **10**.
- Centreline vertices: **250 total** (25 per source).
- Actual `check_corridor` result on CLI output: **`[]` (PASS)**.
- Shapely validity and finite JSON: **PASS** for every output feature.
- Two real CLI runs: **byte-identical output**; input snapshot hashes preserved.
- Stable ignored output artifact: `.venv/plume-validation-24h.geojson`.
- Direct plume pytest: **65 passed, 0 failed**.
- Full repository pytest: **322 passed, 0 failed, 1 existing Requests warning**.
- Runtime: **Python 3.14.3**; Python 3.12 grammar/API inspection passed, runtime not available.
- Source-detection algorithm SHA-256 unchanged; all `data/live/` snapshots unchanged.

Displayed metrics are rounded; stored GeoJSON retains full precision. Bearings
are the **net centre-of-mass displacement** clockwise from true north, while
line lengths sum the whole curved path. The real outputs have heterogeneous
directions: south, east/northeast, and west/southwest. They are not directed
toward a chosen city. The largest-FRP source (`src_004`) has a net displacement
of **19.403 km at 164.21 degrees (south-southeast)**, with an **80.299 km**
centreline path reflecting changing winds and continuous emissions.

| Source | Grid cells | Polygons | Puffs | Line points | Line km | Net km | Bearing deg | Peak delta ug/m3 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| src_001 | 5589 | 2 | 24 | 25 | 109.880 | 17.767 | 177.30 | 10.163 |
| src_002 | 4028 | 4 | 24 | 25 | 100.825 | 61.319 | 98.11 | 10.578 |

| src_007 | 9718 | 4 | 24 | 25 | 38.342 | 20.560 | 261.83 | 19.077 |
| src_008 | 3496 | 4 | 24 | 25 | 52.005 | 16.899 | 250.64 | 32.455 |

**Real 48-hour validation: unavailable with these captures.** The default
`--live` CLI correctly exits 1: the requested window begins at the latest
input capture (`2026-10-08T14:52:16.603976Z`) and ends two days later,
outside the real wind endpoint (`2026-10-08T17:30:00Z`). It preserves
the previous corridor. A 32-hour replay also failed the local-wind limit
at `(31.21159, 72.95891)` on `2026-10-08T14:41:00Z`; no wind was invented
outside the configured 50 km neighborhood. A full **48-hour simulation**
is verified by labelled mathematical tests, not by these real captures.

**Recommendation: READY_FOR_CALIBRATION** for the implemented baseline.
Before fitting or assessing real predictive skill, capture fresh wind with
the corrected UTC parser, provide sufficient temporal/spatial coverage,
and collect actual PM2.5 histories. No calibration engine or ML was implemented
at that Task 2 checkpoint; the later Task 3 and Task 4 sections describe their
subsequent implementation and current limitations.

## Historical calibration eligibility (Task 3)

```text
REAL_CALIBRATION_STATUS: BLOCKED_NO_VALID_HISTORICAL_DATA
CALIBRATION_STATUS: BLOCKED_NO_VALID_HISTORICAL_DATA
CALIBRATION_HOLDOUT: NOT_AVAILABLE
PARAMETER_SOURCE: BASELINE_DEFAULT
```

The [historical data inventory and eligibility audit](CALIBRATION_INVENTORY.md)
documents the actual files, timestamp ranges, counts, units, provenance,
repository history, background eligibility, leakage risks and identifiability.
The real AQI snapshot contains 60 stations and 59 dated PM2.5 measurements,
with only one record per station. Fifty-eight measurements precede the first
captured fire; the last, at 08:00 UTC on October 7, has no same-station
background and predates every current source's last detection. Git history
contains no additional distinct AQI, fire or wind capture. Publication and
validation copies do not add independent observations.

No eligible observed PM2.5-minus-background target or independent event holdout
exists. The archived wind's timing also remains unconfirmed after the parser
defect described above. The original Task 3 audit stopped implementation here.
The completion task adds the gated engine below without executing a real-data
optimizer or creating `params.json`, historical fixtures or ML.
All four calibration parameters remain **ASSUMED**:
`sigma0_m=2000`, `k_m_sqrt_hour=1000`, `tau_hours=24`,
`concentration_scale_ug=1e12`. Existing explicit parameter overrides retain
their documented behavior; no supplied file is certified as calibrated.

Matched events/stations/targets are **0/0/0**. Baseline, fitted, event-level,
station-level and holdout RMSE/MAE/bias are **NOT_AVAILABLE**. No background
or apparently precise fit was invented. A future calibration
must evaluate station-time puff concentrations, rather than the spatial/time
peak stored in corridor band properties, and protect later independent events
from fitting and background/target leakage.

Original Task 3 audit recommendation: **FIX_REQUIRED** for data readiness. The baseline's
Task 2 readiness above does not imply that calibration data is available.
The audit reran the existing suites: **65 plume tests passed, 0 failed**;
**322 repository tests passed, 0 failed**, with one existing Requests warning
on Python 3.14.3. Captured snapshots and model implementations were preserved.

## Calibration engine and eligibility

`history.py` validates provenance, chronology and observations, constructs
pre-event backgrounds, freezes puff-based associations and splits physical
events. `calibrate.py` provides `calibrate(history, config=..., background_estimator=...)`
returning `CalibrationResult`. Its `to_dict()` and sorted JSON serialization
are deterministic. `parameters.py` validates and atomically writes/loads
parameter artifacts. No module makes network requests or downloads data.

The [2026-10-11 frozen protocol](../../docs/calibration/PROTOCOL.md) and
[session report](../../docs/calibration/REPORT.md) separate eligibility from
numerical mechanics. A real experiment now requires a content-bound protocol,
explicit training/validation/protected-test episodes and separate runtime review.
The current captures still do not authorize fitting.

The current repository still returns `BLOCKED_NO_VALID_HISTORICAL_DATA`, with
`optimizer_executed=false`, `fitted_parameters=null` and no `params.json`.
Unavailable metrics are JSON `null`, never zero errors. Results retain dataset
metadata, accepted/rejected records/reasons, source/event/station provenance,
background references, transport ages, wind/PBLH, parameter statuses, metrics,
leakage checks, warnings and sensitivity diagnostics when available.

```bash
python -m models.plume.calibrate
# Current real repository: deterministic JSON on stdout, exit 1.

python -m models.plume.calibrate --history data/history/calibration.json --report .venv/new-calibration-report.json --params-output .venv/new-calibration-candidate.json
# Future eligible reviewed manifest: export a candidate pending expert review.
```

Default discovery checks `data/history/calibration.json` and
`data/historical/calibration.json`. Multiple manifests require explicit selection;
there is no automatic merge. Without a manifest the CLI inventories actual live
inputs and reports rejection. `--history` selects a local manifest;
`--params-output` explicitly requests a separate successful candidate artifact;
without it no parameter file is written. The runtime `models/plume/params.json`
destination is forbidden for calibration exports. `--report` may
save blocked metadata. Outputs cannot overwrite consumed history/live inputs
or each other. Blocked/invalid runs preserve previous parameters and snapshots.

## Future historical manifest schema

The internal schema is version 1 and does not change pipeline contracts.
No example historical measurements are shipped. Assemble these fields from
independently reviewed real captures, preserving original observations:

| Level | Required fields |
| --- | --- |
| Manifest | `schema_version=1`, `evidence_kind="REAL_CAPTURED_HISTORY"`, `provenance`, aware `calibration_timestamp`, frozen `protocol`, `events`, `observations` |
| Provenance | `kind="REAL_CAPTURED_HISTORY"`, nonempty `source`, `capture_id`, `archive_reference`, `timing_verified=true` |
| Event | Unique `capture_id`, persistent physical `event_id`, aware `source_event_time`, `forecast_start`, actual contract-shaped `fires`, `sources`, `wind`, and `provenance` |
| Event provenance | `event_group_verified=true`, `attribution_verified=true`, independent `attribution_reference`; separate `fires`, `sources`, `wind` provenance objects, each with verified aware `available_at` and `content_sha256` matching `history.content_hash(payload)` |
| Observation | Unique `id`, stable `station_id`, WGS84 `lat`/`lon`, aware `period_start`, `observed_at`, `available_at`, finite nonnegative `pm25_ugm3`, `unit="ug/m3"`, `observational=true`, `quality_verified=true`, `averaging_period_verified=true`, provenance with payload digest excluding the provenance object |
| Protocol | Version 1, `id`, `model_version`, receptor-increment `target`, aware `frozen_at`, `code_sha256`, `search_definition`, `search_sha256`, `history_inputs_sha256`, reviewed rules/rationale, station policy, acceptance criteria and explicit `training`/`validation`/`test` event IDs |

Use `models.plume.protocol.code_identity()` and `search_definition(config)` to
bind actual code/settings. `history_inputs_sha256` hashes the complete manifest
excluding `protocol`. The search digest hashes `search_definition` using
`history.content_hash`. Required review strings are `scientific_question`,
`inclusion_rules`, `exclusion_rules`, `quality_review`, `attribution_review`,
`uncertainty_plan`, `limitations`, `reviewer` and a `parameter_rationale` entry
for each axis. `test_previously_used` must be exactly false. Accepted station
policies are `SAME_STATIONS_NEW_EVENTS` and `DISJOINT_STATIONS`. Acceptance records
`min_relative_rmse_improvement` in (0,1) and nonnegative
`max_mae_regression_ugm3`. These declarations must be independently reviewed;
software cannot establish the truth of a provenance assertion or physical bounds.

`content_hash` hashes sorted finite JSON of the parsed payload, independent of
file whitespace. Digests check consistency; provenance flags are auditable
assertions by the archive owner, not authentication of atmospheric truth.
Review units, quality, timing and physical event grouping before marking them
verified. Model-generated or mathematical values cannot be relabelled real.

Packet availability must be independently recorded; fetch-start/generation times
are not an availability substitute. Availability cannot precede generation and
must precede prediction. Sources must reproduce exactly from their packet's frozen fires using the
unchanged detector defaults. `source_event_time` is the earliest contributing
source detection. Source/wind generation times and latest contributing detection
must be strictly before `forecast_start`; target intervals must follow it.
Later-captured hindcast inputs are deliberately ineligible for automatic
prospective adoption. The plume CLI retains its labelled archive-replay API.
Calibration timestamp is an explicit analysis/run reference supplied in the
manifest, must follow observation availability, and is never generated from
the wall clock.

Targets may be instantaneous hourly frames (`period_start=observed_at`) or
averaging intervals whose endpoints align to whole hours 1 through 48 after
the forecast start. Interval predictions use the trapezoidal mean of hourly
puff concentrations, not band maxima. Nonaligned intervals fail without shifting
timestamps. Duplicate station timestamps and overlapping measurement intervals
are rejected. Resource limits are 100 event captures and 10,000 observations.

## Background and transport matching

Default background is the median of at least three same-station readings within
24 hours before the earliest contributing fire. Coordinates and averaging
durations must match the target. Whole periods must finish before the event
and be available before prediction. Target/future values and other stations
cannot supply background. The target is observed PM2.5 minus background,
including negative deltas.

A pluggable estimator receives only eligible pre-event readings, never target
PM2.5. It returns `BackgroundEstimate(value_ugm3, observation_ids, method)`.
Cited IDs must be distinct eligible readings and meet the minimum; the finite,
nonnegative estimate must remain within their measured range. Plugins are
trusted local mathematical functions and must not use external target data
or supply invented constants.

Matching runs once using baseline puff geometry, before optimization and without
target concentrations. A receptor must have real local wind/PBLH coverage.
At a relevant frame, an aged puff must have travelled at least 1 km, the
source-to-puff direction must align with source-to-station direction (cosine
at least 0.5), and the receptor must lie within two baseline sigmas of its centre.
These are engineering association policies, not validated attribution criteria.
Zero travel, upwind geometry and radius-only matches fail. Matching stays fixed
across all parameter candidates.

Repeated captures of one physical event remain together; the latest eligible
capture supplies a target without consulting PM2.5. Targets plausible for
multiple independent events are rejected as ambiguous. Predictions sum matched
sources' puff concentrations at the station/time. Every matched target is
excluded from background references.

## Chronological protection and minimum history

Candidate evaluation requires at least four physical event groups: two training,
one validation and one protected test group. Each partition requires two stations;
training requires four targets and validation/test require two each. These minimums are
engineering gates, not evidence of statistical generalization. Event grouping
must be independently reviewed; overlapping fire identities assigned different
event IDs are rejected. Snapshot-ranked `src_*` values are not event IDs.

Explicit event IDs are frozen before fitting. Full 48-hour windows of each earlier
partition must finish strictly before the next partition's source episode. Check
every frozen capture before matching, including unmatched captures; those captures
remain in their predeclared event group and do not increase eligible-target counts.
Target/background IDs and repeated fire identities must be disjoint across
partitions. Declared
station holdouts are enforced; repeated known stations imply only new-event
evaluation. No random row split, future input, test-based selection or manual
event tuning is allowed. Insufficient groups, stations, targets or clean chronology
block optimization. The older two-way `chronological_split` utility remains for
compatibility/testing and no longer authorizes a calibration experiment.

## Bounded search, sensitivity and adoption

`CalibrationConfig` holds all axes, budgets and sensitivity tolerances. The
initial grid has 625 combinations. Bounds are factor-of-two engineering priors
around the baseline, not physically validated ranges:

| Parameter | Bounds | Grid values |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sigma0_m` | 1000 to 4000 m | 1000, 1500, 2000, 3000, 4000 |
| `k_m_sqrt_hour` | 500 to 2000 m/sqrt(hour) | 500, 750, 1000, 1500, 2000 |
| `tau_hours` | 12 to 48 hours | 12, 18, 24, 36, 48 |
| `concentration_scale_ug` | 5e11 to 2e12 ug/nominal-puff-strength | 5e11, 7.5e11, 1e12, 1.5e12, 2e12 |

Custom axes must declare bounds, include baseline values and respect the
candidate budget (625 by default). Nonpositive sigma/tau/scale, negative k,
nonfinite numbers and out-of-bound values fail. Explicitly bounded zero k is
permitted by the physical model. Bounds are never expanded to fit current data.

The objective is ordinary target-level training RMSE; MAE and prediction-minus-
observation bias are also reported. Baseline and candidates use identical frozen
targets. Transport is cached because these four parameters do not change
advection; sigma/decay are recomputed with existing formulas. Equal errors prefer
values nearer baseline, then deterministic parameter order. Event/station
metrics and training target shares expose dominance; above 50% triggers a warning.

Parameter variation among errors within `max(0.1 ug/m3, 1% of best RMSE)` marks
weak identification. Boundary optima are also unsupported. Such parameters
retain baseline values; the engine reselects with them fixed and inspects
sensitivity at the retained optimum. Equivalent grid values and fixed-other-
parameter profiles are reported, not confidence intervals or false precision.
The known source-radius floor can make sigma0 inactive.

Evaluate baseline on all partitions before fitting. Acceptance requires an
identified parameter, training improvement, and the predeclared RMSE improvement
and MAE tolerance on validation and test, with no event-level RMSE regression.
Validation failure stops before candidate test evaluation. The selected parameters
are frozen before test; test is never used to retune. A supported subset yields
`PARTIALLY_CALIBRATED`; other parameters remain `ASSUMED`. These internal numerical
statuses describe an unapproved candidate, not scientific certification.

## Parameter artifacts and precedence

Successful version-2 candidate artifacts contain all physical/numerical values, four parameter
units/statuses, dataset provenance/hash/counts/time range, explicit calibration
timestamp, model/schema version, RMSE objective, baseline/fitted/holdout metrics,
three-way event split, frozen protocol/code/dataset hashes, per-target predictions,
recomputed partition/subgroup metrics, leakage checks and identifiability diagnostics.
They retain `history_inputs` (the complete original manifest excluding `protocol`),
bound to both the protocol input digest and full dataset digest. Saved-artifact
acceptance rechecks all capture windows, frozen observation/station identities and
the actual station sets required by `DISJOINT_STATIONS`. Malformed protocol objects
and nested structures fail with a clear `ValueError`.
They carry `PENDING_EXPERT_REVIEW` and `runtime_approved=false`. Serialization forbids
NaN/infinity; atomic replacement follows validation.

`load_parameters()` returns `LoadedParameters(params, provenance, metadata)`:

1. Explicit `PlumeParams` or dict wins, labelled `EXPLICIT`. Missing fields in
   an explicit dict retain the existing API's baseline defaults.
2. Otherwise a validated local `models/plume/params.json` requires a separate
   `runtime_approval` before supplying `CALIBRATED` values for development evaluation.
3. An absent file supplies documented `BASELINE` values.

Existing corrupt, wrong-version/unit, blocked, mathematical or non-improving
artifacts fail closed; they do not silently fall back. Legacy real artifacts without
the frozen three-way protocol fail closed. The approval requires status
`APPROVED_FOR_DEVELOPMENT_EVALUATION`, a named `reviewer`, aware `reviewed_at` not
before calibration, and `candidate_sha256=parameters.candidate_digest(document)`.
The digest excludes only `runtime_approval`. This is trusted local operator review,
not supplier authentication or operational certification. The existing plume
`resolve_params` path and pipeline use this loader. CLI `--params` supports
flat explicit overrides (still labelled `EXPLICIT`) or a reviewed calibration
artifact through the same loader. GeoJSON fields
remain unchanged; loader metadata carries provenance outside the shared contract.

Numerical optimizer/artifact tests are labelled `MATHEMATICAL_TEST`. Their optional
serialization path cannot write a file named `params.json`, and the production
loader rejects them. No real historical fixture has appeared and no numerical
test is presented as observational calibration. Completion recommendation:
**READY_FOR_VALID_HISTORY**, with actual calibration still blocked.

## Completion validation

- `pytest models/plume`: **116 passed, 0 failed** (4.57 seconds).
- Full `pytest`: **377 passed, 0 failed**, one existing Requests dependency
  warning (16.03 seconds).
- Runtime: **Python 3.14.3**. Seven changed/new Python files also passed Python
  3.12 grammar parsing; no Python 3.12 runtime or Lambda packaging was verified.
- Actual default calibration CLI: **exit 1**, BLOCKED_NO_VALID_HISTORICAL_DATA,
  optimizer not executed, matches 0/0/0, fitted values null, `params.json` absent.
- Real FIRMS detector output in an isolated live-input copy: **22 sources**;
  a covered 2-hour archive replay from 2026-10-07T08:41:00Z yielded **36 features**.
  Actual source/corridor validators returned `[]`, and all geometries were valid.
  This newly computed detector output does not overwrite the older 10-source
  snapshot or add an independent event.
- Default uncovered plume CLI failed and preserved the prior valid corridor.
  Missing-input and invalid-parameter preservation also passed pipeline tests.
- Source detection and all original real snapshot/publication-copy hashes were
  preserved. No network, downloads, historical observations, commits or PR edits.

## Task 4 optional ML point surrogate

The optional [training package](../training/README.md) trains a small deterministic
`HistGradientBoostingRegressor` on `BASELINE_SIMULATED` targets from this engine's
actual `simulate_source()` and `concentration_at()` calls. Physics equations,
parameter loading, the source detector, published snapshots and the corridor
pipeline are unchanged. No calibrated `params.json` is created by ML training.

Its defined scope is one steady-weather source emitting hourly puffs for 1–12
hours, sampled at a point relative to a fixed numerical reference origin. Its
ordered features include wind speed/toward direction, downwind/crosswind position,
elapsed forecast hours, PBLH, emission strength and source radius. It cannot
replace changing-weather or 48-hour corridor forecasts. Train, validation and
test are disjoint scenario groups; targets are neither clipped nor observational.

`models.training.predict.predict_point()` defaults to `model="physics"` for these
reference scenarios. `model="surrogate"` explicitly requires a valid artifact.
An absent artifact does not affect the existing physics pipeline. Strict local
SageMaker training/inference contracts, artifact provenance and the held-out
[evaluation report](../training/evaluation_report.json) are documented with the
training package; no cloud deployment is claimed.

Generated-test ML RMSE/MAE/bias are 6.871639/1.785270/−0.777798 µg/m³, with a
99.114390 µg/m³ worst absolute error. Replayed physics has zero error against its
own generated targets, an identity check rather than observational accuracy.
The surrogate demonstrates numerical approximation only. Physics remains the
production default; promotion requires independent observational evidence and
repeatable improvements under the decision rule in the training README. Task 3
real-history calibration remains `BLOCKED_NO_VALID_HISTORICAL_DATA`.

Task 4 verification on Python 3.14.3: training **66 passed**, plume **116 passed**,
full suite **443 passed**, with one existing Requests dependency warning. All 30
protected source/physics/pipeline and real snapshot hashes were preserved.
Python 3.12 was grammar-checked only; no 3.12 runtime or cloud deployment was tested.
